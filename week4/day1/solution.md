1. Imagine you get the following trace <br/>

0,2,4,6,8,10,12 <br/>

from your program (which simply doubles the previous value.) <br/>

Write out the constraints for this trace, in terms of i, j <br/>

```

A0 = 0 Ai = Ai-1 + 2 A6 = 12

```

2. Polynomial practice for p(x) = x^3 − 5x^2 − 4x + 20 <br/>

a) find an integer root a , i.e. p(a)=0  (clue < 7) <br/>

```

p(2) = 0
p(5) = 0

```

b) write this in terms of a lower degree polynomial

```

deg(q) = 2
deg(p) = 3

```
