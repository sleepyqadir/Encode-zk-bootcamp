## Maths Introduction

Some modular arithmetic

1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}. what is <br />

a) 4+4 ?


**answer**:
```

 1 mod 7 => 1

```

b) 3 x 5 ?

**answer**:
```

 1 mod 7 => 1

```
c) what is the inverse of 3?

c 5 (3**(7-2) = 243, mod 7 = 5)

**answer**:
```

3^-1 
=> 3**(7-2)
=> 243 
=> 243 mod 7
=> 5 mod 7 
=> 5

```

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ? <br />

**answer**: 

```

yes

```


3. what is -13 mod 5? <br />

**answer**: 
```

-13 mod 5 
=> -3 mod 5
=> 2 mod 5
=> 2 

```


## User Cases:

In your groups, think of some use cases of zero knowledge proofs
What problems are there when using zkps in real world situations ? <br />

**There are several use cases of zero-knowledge proofs. Some are:**

    1. privacy-preserving application
    2. scalability
