# Homework 2

## 1) Group / Field Theory

Take the set of bits B = {0,1} and the operation ⊕ with the following rules:

```

`0 ⊕ 0 = 0`
`0 ⊕ 1 = 1`
`1 ⊕ 0 = 1`
`1 ⊕ 1 = 0`

```

Does the set B and the operation ⊕ satisfy the group properties ? 

**answer**:

```
yes

```

## 2) Group / Field Theory

**note**: 
you just need to find examples, you don't need to prove anything.

1. Is it true that all odd squares are ≡ 1 (mod 8) ?


**answer**:
```

1 mod 8 => 1 , 9 mod 8 => 1 , 25 mod 8 => 1

yes

```

2. what about even squares (mod 8) ?

```

4 mod 8 => 4 , 16 mod 8 => 0

no 

```

4. What do you understand by <br/>

    **1) O(n):** means proportion to the number of items. linear complexity <br/>

   **2) O(1):** means in constant time, independent of the number of items. Constant complexity <br/>

    **3) o(log n):** mean a time proportional to log(N). logarithmic complexity <br/>

<br/><br/>

5. Which of those is best when describing a proof size , <br/>

```

O(log n)

```
