1. How Aztec differs from ZCash and Tornado Cash. <br/>

* Aztec brings the anonymity of the amount of transfer between the parties, but the parties/addresses involved in the transaction will remain public. While in the tornado cash, we have a fixed amount of pool that remains public to the network while the parties remain hidden.
* ZCash is built on the bitcoin UTXO model. Therefore, they are hiding all aspects of transactions.
* Aztec is based on the UTXO model. Tornado cash is working on the fixed amount to deposit. While tornado cash two also has the UTXO.
* Aztec is layer two rollup, zCash is layer one, while tornado cash is an application built on layer 1.

2. The future for Aztec and private transactions on Ethereum in light of what has

* Due to government enforcement, it is tough to regulate the zk-based privacy transaction system in the future.
* This can work if we can bring the KFC into the system.
